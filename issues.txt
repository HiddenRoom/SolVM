SOLVED: wierd extra strings generated (sometimes theyre real words like glibc) might be reading so random section of disk-memory that, if allocated, may contain logical
data but this is unlikely since the string "glibc" seems to pop up alot and i dont have random files across my disk with that in them

opcode is overwriting operand and first part of value in each instruction with itself
for example: JMP 258 becomes 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x02 instead of 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x02

assembler segfaults but all tests work

OPEN:
